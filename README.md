# GTA San Andreas "DLC" Project
This mod adds various new interiors and side missions across San Andreas.

So far, this mod adds 3 stores to the Bayside town.  These are: ZIP, Ammunation, and Binco.

Most of the locations have been added, still working on adding the ENEX markers.*

Update: ENEX markers have been added.

If you would like to download the bayside expansion **only,**  search for Bayside Expansion Mod in my repos.
